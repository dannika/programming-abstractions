"Cheetah Sisters"

Theres a time when we all choose
To either quit or follow through
To just loose faith
Or trust your heart
To somehow lead you through the dark
You're not the only one who's dreamin'
And who needs help to carry on
We might get lonely but we're not alone

Cause we are sisters
We stand together
We make up one big family though we don't look the same
Our spots are different
Different colors
We make each other stronger
That ain't ever gonna change
We're cheetah girls cheetah sisters

Gotta do what we gotta do
Got the brains, got the power and we speak the truth
We're from everywhere all around the world
So ya best respect the cheetah girls
Dancing, singing from our birth
Working hard for what we deserve
Trying not to break the rules
'Cause mama didn't raise no fools
It may seem we're only dreaming
And we need help to carry on
Its good to know we're not alone

Cause we are sisters
We stand together
We make up one big family though we don't look the same
Our spots are different
Different colors
We make each other stronger
That ain't ever gonna change
Believe it mister
We're cheetah girls cheetah sisters

Someone's always there behind
To catch us if we fall

Cause we are sisters
We stand together
We make up one big family though we don't look the same
Our spots are different
Different colors
We make each other stronger
That ain't ever gonna change

Believe it mister
We're cheetah girls cheetah sisters


"Cinderella"

When I was just a little girl,
My mama used to tuck me into bed,
And she'd read me a story.

It always was about a princess in distress
And how a guy would save her
And end up with the glory.

I'd lie in bed
And think about
The person that I wanted to be,

Then one day I realized
The fairy tale life wasn’t for me.

I don’t wanna be like Cinderella,
Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar,
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free
I don’t wanna be like someone waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
On I will survive
Unless somebody's on my side
Don't wanna be no, no, no one else.
I’d rather rescue myself.

Someday I'm gonna find Someone
That wants somebody's soul, heart and mind
Who's not afraid to show that he loves me
Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I am
Don't need nobody taking care of me
(I will be there) I will be there for him just as strong as he will be there for me
when I give myself then it has got to be an equal thing

I can slay (I can slay) my own dragons (my own dragons)
I can dream my own dreams (my own dreams)
My knight in shining armor (shining armor) is me.
So I'm gonna set me free.

I don’t wanna be like Cinderella,
Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar,
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free.
I don’t wanna be like someone waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
On I will survive
Unless somebody's on my side

I don’t wanna be like Cinderella,
Sitting in a dark, cold, dusty cellar,
Waiting for somebody to come and set me free, no.
I don’t wanna be like someone waiting
For a handsome prince to come and save me
On I will survive
Unless somebody's on my side
Don't wanna be no, no, no one else.
I’d rather rescue myself.


"Girl Power"

Throw your hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up never say die
Girl Power Girl Power!!
Throw your hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up never come too far
Girl Power Girl Power!!

I've made mistakes before but I know I'm not perfect
It's okay 'cause who could ever be
As long as I did my best
It don't matter what no one says
'cause deep down in my heart I got the power to make it all happen

Throw your hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up never say die
Girl Power Girl Power!!
Throw your hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up never come too far
Girl Power Girl Power!!

At times I may just feel like
my back is to the wall,
I hold my head up high
And keep on standin' tall
I know that my back is covered
Because we have each other
and we're down for whatever.
If you hear me throw your hands up

Throw your hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up never say die
Girl Power Girl Power!!
Throw your hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up never come too far
Girl Power Girl Power!!

Sometimes life may get you down
But you better hold your ground
Can't nobody live your life but you
Stay true to who you are
And always follow your heart
Your heart, your heart

Throw your hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up never say die
Girl Power Girl Power!!
Throw your hands up if you know that you're a star
You better stand up if you know just who you are
Never give up never come too far
Girl Power Girl Power!!


"Together We Can"

We can do anything
Just you and me baby baby baby baby baby babe
Wait and see.

Hold on, sit tight.
Are you ready for a crazy ride?
Your on your own, it ain't right.
Something gotta give tonight.

So if you wanna run, run and disappear.
You and I can bust our way right out of here.

Together we can.
Shoot the moon, stop the rain even ride a hurricane,
If we wanna.
Together we can.
Walk into space, save the human race, do you think we oughta, oughta? [x2]

Here we take our time, we can have it all.
I don't think we're gonna make it on our own.

Together we can.
Even ride a hurricane, if we wanna. (C'mon)
Walk into space save the human race.
Do you think we oughta?
Together we can!


"Strut"

You can breathe in the music the city makes
Move by the rhythm the Gypsies play
Deep inside it comes alive.

There is a whisper that feeds your soul
Word's so beautiful like a Spanish rose
Till you hypnotize that's when you arrive

You got to strut like you mean it
Free your mind
It's not enough just to dream it
Come on, come on.
Get up when you feel it
It's your chance to shine
Strut like you mean it
Come on, come on, come on, yeah.
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

Deep in the pavements kicking through the streets
To wonder like Picasso in the Barcelona heat.
Passion is the fashion and life is poetry
We welcome to another worlds where every heart can beat (ow, ow)

In a different tempo there's never a wrong one (never a wrong one (never a wrong one))
Building to a crescendo
You know the journey is just begun (ah, ah, ah).

Hey feel the flow when you just can't move no more (no more)
The city wants to show (aha) you something (something), something (something)
A heart unfolds (unfolds ) that you will never know (never know)
Barcelona soul (uh) says something (something), something good is coming, is coming, yeah
Everybody knows that something good is coming on!

You got to strut...

Bienvenidas esto es mi sueño
Come on, come on, get up!
Síganme y descubran mi Barcelona
Stand! Come on, come on!
Bienvenidas esto es mi sueño
Come on, come on...


"Amigas Cheetahs"

No matter where we come from we can be ourselves and still be... one
AMIGAS CHEETAHS
FRIENDS FOR LIFE
THE RHYTHM AND EACH OTHER
THAT'S WHAT KEEPS US TIGHT
AMIGAS CHEETAHS
LIVIN' THE DREAM
NOTHING'S EVER GONNA COME BETWEEN US
AMIGAS

What could be any better than
Knowin' someone will be there when
You gotta pour your heart out
Tell your secrets to
Someone who lets you be yourself
There when you need help
They’ve got your back win or lose

Kickin' it with 'em just for fun
Or when you need the 411
Someone who gives a shout out
When lose your faith
Just when you think nobody can ever understand
They're right here to
Show you the way
AHH, AHH, AHH, AHH...
AHH, AHH, OOOOOH
Friends for life

YA QUE ESTAMOS JUNTAS
ESTAMOS EN UN MUNDO
DONDE SOMOS UNO POR LA MUSICA
If we just believe it
You know we can be it
Nothin' can stand in our way
Stand in our way
